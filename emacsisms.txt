EmacsWiki.org has a ton of info.


My "slides":

Why I like Emacs:

* Runs everywhere
* Completely open source and in Lisp
* Easy to customize:
  * customize command
  * start with ~/.emacs
* Functions gallow, that operate on buffers
* Self documenting: C-h f TAB TAB, C-h v TAB TAB, C-h k, C-h b
* Maps keys to functions
* Repeat

Common Keys:

* Cursor movement: C-f C-b C-p C-n
* Open file: C-x C-f
* Save file: C-x C-s
* Run command: M-x
* Stop command: M-g
* Change buffers: C-x C-b
* Search forward/backward: C-s C-r
* Copy, cut, and paste: A-w C-w C-y
* Undo: C-x u
* Exit: C-x C-c
* Window splitting:
  * C-x b 1 
  * C-x b 2
  * C-x b 3
  * C-x b 0
* Window movement: C-x o
