#### Teaching Ruby as a First Language 

##### Biggest Problem 

We don't know where students are coming from, and where they are going.

##### Why Ruby?

* No one knows it
* Students dno't automatically slack off
* Clean syntax
* Fully OO
* Constructs lend to diagramming and discussion

##### How are we doing it?

* Assign a one-month workshop with daily tasks.
* Use variety of online tutorials.
* Provide support, not instruction.
* Require completion; expect drop-outs.

##### Student Question War Stories

(Various code blunders presented.)

##### What's Next?

Almost nobody is teaching Ruby at the University level.
Basically nobody is teaching it as a first language.

Ruby is good for teaching:
* Web development
* OO design
* Testing / TDD
* ...
