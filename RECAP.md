Greetings Indy.rb Members:

Thanks to all for a great meetup event last night!

If you haven't had a chance to make a meetup in a while, we invite you to come back.  Whether you are just getting your feet wet with Ruby and Rails, a curious Java developer, or a Ruby ninja we welcome you to join in the fun.  The meetings can be a great way to learn new things, bounce problems/ideas off of others, network and just hang out with a nice bunch of folks.


RECAP
---------------------
Last night's meeting featured a showdown between TextMate, Emacs and Vim.  While no clear code editor emerged as winner, I think it is safe to say that Dave & Miles' lively Vim presentation took home Best Dramatic Performance In A Live (Non-Recorded) Screencast.

Also discussed was the Rails/Merb merger, Gems & Plugins, the rails-footnotes plugin, Tetris via Emacs, and a host of other topics.

Afterwards, a number of us got together at the Brockway Pub for more discussion and drinks.

We want to again thank Engine Yard for the generous sponsorship of last night's Meetup!  They provided funding for pizza and drinks as well as passing along t-shirts. We greatly appreciate their generosity and continual contributions to the Ruby community.
